Forensic cockpit and operational dashboards.

## What is Watchtower?

Watchtower is the visualization layer for Tracehound:

- **Forensic Dashboard** — Visualize evidence and threats
- **Timeline View** — See attack progression over time
- **Incident Response** — Tools for investigation workflow
- **Alerting** — Configure notifications and escalations

---

## What Watchtower Is NOT

Watchtower is a visualization tool. It does **not**:

- Create evidence (that's Core)
- Make security decisions (that's your detector + Talos)
- Replace your SIEM (it complements it)
